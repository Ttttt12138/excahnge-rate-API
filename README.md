Currency Exchange Rate API Data Analysis Project

This is a Python-based currency exchange rate data analysis project, primarily used for processing and visualizing exchange rate-related data. The project is built using the Streamlit framework to create dashboards and supports cloud deployment. Core features include dynamic KPI calculation, data exploration analysis (EDA), and correlation analysis. The project also includes a data output module and requirements documentation, supporting trend line analysis and an automatic fallback mechanism.
